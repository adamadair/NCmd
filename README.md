# NCmd
Provides a simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters in C#. Inspired by the Python cmd library.

## Features
- Provides the Cmd class to quickly create command line shell program.
- Shell commands can be created using method naming conventions or method arguments.
- A command line argument parser.
- Live help
- Auto command completion
- Works with .NET Framework 4.5 or better, .NET Standard 2.0, and .NET Core 2.0

## Prerequisites
- A C# compiler to build the files. 
- Visual Studio 2017 is required to build the solution.

I developed this for use on Windows systems, but I did some testing using Mono on Mac. It is possible that the code will
work on earlier versions of the .NET Framework but I have had no reason to even try.
