# NCmd
Provides a simple framework for writing line-oriented command interpreters in C#. Inspired by the Python cmd library.

## Prerequisites
- A C# compiler to build the files. I used Visual Studio 2015.
- A version of the .NET Framework or Mono, starting with 4.5

I developed this for use on Windows systems, but I did some testing using Mono on Mac. It is possible that the code will
work on earlier versions of the .NET Framework but I have had no reason to even try.
